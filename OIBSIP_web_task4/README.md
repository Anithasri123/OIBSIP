# 🔐 Login Authentication System – Task 4 (OIBSIP)

This is my Task 4 project for the AICTE Oasis Infobyte Internship.

I created a simple login authentication system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ✅ Features

- User registration with username and password
- User login with validation
- Access to a secured page after successful login
- Basic front-end validations
- User-friendly UI

This task helped me understand the flow of login systems, form handling, and basic authentication logic.

> Note: This is a front-end-only project. In a real-world scenario, password handling and user data should be managed securely on the backend.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
